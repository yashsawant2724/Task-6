## Key Learnings

- **Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.**
- **Longer passwords (12+ characters) are significantly stronger.**
- Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns.
- Use password managers to generate and store complex passwords.

## Common Password Attacks

- **Brute Force**: Trying every possible combination.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Using common words from a preloaded dictionary.
- **Phishing**: Tricking users into giving away credentials.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Reusing leaked username-password pairs.


## Tips to Create Strong Passwords

- Use at least **12 characters**
- Combine all **character types** (Aa1!)
